"""Anti-drift tests for the committed self-contained Cowork plugin.

Cowork's marketplace renders a plugin only when its ``source`` points at a
small self-contained dir. The desktop ``token-optimizer`` entry has
``source: "./"`` (the whole ~328MB repo) and does NOT render in Cowork, so a
SLIM sibling is committed at ``cowork/token-optimizer/`` and listed as its own
marketplace plugin ``token-optimizer-cowork``. That committed tree is BUILT by
``cowork_install.py --emit-committed`` from the master runtime set, so it can
silently drift from the source it was generated off. These tests are the
tripwire: they rebuild via the packager API and assert the committed tree still
matches, byte for byte where it must.

Covers:
  (a) committed hooks/hooks.json == build_cowork_hooks(master hooks/hooks.json)
      -- trimmed to the 4 Cowork events, no SessionStart, keepwarm dropped, and
      the run-once features carried on UserPromptSubmit.
  (b) committed .claude-plugin/plugin.json has name token-optimizer-cowork, the
      ./hooks/hooks.json pointer, and version == root plugin.json version.
  (c) skills/token-optimizer/scripts/measure.py exists in the committed dir and
      is byte-identical to the root one.
  (d) rebuilding via ``build_committed_plugin()`` INTO A STAGING ROOT
      reproduces the committed cowork/token-optimizer/ byte for byte (no
      drift). The rebuild never runs against the working tree: a test that
      regenerates in place can destroy uncommitted work, and the clean
      ``git status`` it then asserts hides the loss.
  (e) the marketplace lists exactly 3 plugins with the expected names/sources.
