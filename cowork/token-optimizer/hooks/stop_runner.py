"""Single-import Stop + SessionEnd dispatcher.

Replaces the THREE separate ``Stop`` hook commands in hooks.json that each
spawned ``python-launcher.sh -> run.py -> module_runner.py -> runpy(measure.py)``
and caused each subcommand to start a separate interpreter and import
``measure.py`` independently:

  1. ``measure.py compact-capture --trigger stop --quiet``             (timeout 12)
  2. ``measure.py session-end-flush --trigger stop --quiet --defer``   (timeout 8)
  3. ``measure.py keepwarm-arm --quiet``                               (timeout 5)

The separate processes also repeat cold imports when a read-only plugin
installation cannot retain ``__pycache__``. Consolidation pays that startup
cost once, then runs the real work under one shared deadline.

The ``SessionEnd`` hook (a fourth entry: ``session-end-flush --trigger end
--defer``, async, timeout 60) joins this runner too. It is a separate hooks.json
entry (different event, ``async: true``, timeout 60) but dispatches the SAME
runner file, branching on ``hook_event_name`` so the trigger value ``end`` is
preserved exactly. This saves one more measure.py import per session end.

This is the same consolidation the ``SessionStart`` and ``UserPromptSubmit``
groups received (``hooks/sessionstart_runner.py``,
``hooks/userpromptsubmit_runner.py``); the structure deliberately mirrors those
files.

Key properties:
  - ONE shared ``HookDeadline`` (13s for Stop, 2s margin under the hooks.json
    timeout of 15; 58s for SessionEnd, 2s margin under timeout 60) replaces the
    three independent per-entry timeouts (12 + 8 + 5 = 25s). Remaining time is
    budgeted fairly across the subcommands still pending (``_runner_budget``);
    the shared deadline's ``os._exit(0)`` is the ONLY kill switch in the
    process, so an early subcommand hang can never preemptively kill later ones.
  - The ``--defer`` behaviour is preserved EXACTLY: ``session-end-flush`` calls
    ``measure._dispatch_session_end_flush`` with the same args list the
    ``__main__`` dispatch received, so the detached worker gets the same
    ``--trigger`` / ``--defer`` / ``--quiet`` flags.
  - The trigger values ``stop`` and ``end`` are preserved EXACTLY so entry
    budget rules can distinguish the Stop and SessionEnd work.
  - The ``async: true`` flag on the SessionEnd hooks.json entry is a host-level
    semantic (fire-and-forget); the runner itself is the same for both events.
  - No once-per-session latching exists in the Stop/SessionEnd chain (none of
    the three subcommands use ``_mark_ran_this_session`` or
    ``_ran_once_this_session``), so there is nothing to preserve there.
  - stdout from all subcommands is captured through one buffered emitter and
    emitted in dispatch order at the end of ``main()``. Under ``--quiet`` (the
    Stop path) all three subcommands produce no stdout; the SessionEnd path
    likewise produces none (``_dispatch_session_end_flush`` only spawns a
    detached worker). The buffer is a safety net for any unexpected output.
  - One subcommand throwing/aborting never aborts the others (each is wrapped in
    ``_run_safely``); the hook always exits 0.
  - No consent gate: the Stop and SessionEnd subcommands are all data
    collection, none bootstrap the consent flags (unlike SessionStart /
    UserPromptSubmit which contain ensure-health). run.py's consent gate
    handles them: when consent is False, run.py returns 0 and the runner never
    fires. The runner is NOT in run.py's exempt list, preserving the
    consent-gated semantics of the three legacy entries.

The runner calls the same module-level entrypoints used by the ``__main__``
dispatch, preserving their arguments and behavior while only changing how
they are scheduled.

Run: ``hooks/stop_runner.py`` (via run.py -> module_runner.py).

# Shared deadline: ONE HookDeadline for the whole runner replaces the three
# independent per-entry timeouts (12 + 8 + 5 = 25s declared for Stop).
#
# WHY 13s for Stop:
#   * The three legacy entries declared 25s combined. The consolidated
#     hooks.json entry declares timeout=15 (well under the 25s original, and
#     under any plausible host ceiling).
#   * The internal deadline is 13s: 2s of margin under the declared 15 so the
#     runner self-exits 0 with its buffered stdout emitted, rather than being
#     SIGKILLed by the host mid-write. Same 2s margin the SessionStart and
#     UserPromptSubmit runners use.
#
# WHY 58s for SessionEnd:
#   * The legacy SessionEnd entry declared timeout=60 with async=true. The
#     consolidated entry preserves both. The internal deadline is 58s (2s
#     margin under 60). The work is trivial (spawn a detached worker and
#     return), so the deadline is a safety net that never fires in practice.
#   * The 58s applies to Claude Code only. The Codex
#     marketplace plugin clamps SessionEnd to timeout=3 (via
#     sync-codex-marketplace-plugin.sh CODEX_SESSION_END_TIMEOUT_CAP=3), so on
#     Codex the host kills the process at 3s and the 58s deadline never fires.
#     The work (spawn detached, return) completes well within 3s, so this is
#     not a functional issue, only a headroom claim that is wrong for one host.
