"""os.fchmod() does not exist on Windows (POSIX-only; unlike os.chmod
there is no Windows implementation, so a bare call raises AttributeError, which is
NOT an OSError subclass and so slips past `except OSError` guards). Two atomic-write
sites in measure.py were unguarded -- the dashboard generator and the keep-warm
scheduler marker writer -- crashing every dashboard build and the marker write on
Windows.

Two layers of protection here:

1. A source guard over the WHOLE bug class: every `os.fchmod(` in measure.py must sit
   under a `hasattr(os, "fchmod")` check. This is the regression tripwire -- it fails
   the instant any future edit adds an unguarded site, regardless of platform.

2. A functional Windows simulation: with `os.fchmod` removed (as on real Windows),
   the dashboard generator and the keep-warm marker writer must complete without an
   AttributeError. mkstemp already creates the temp file 0600, so dropping the fchmod
   loses nothing on Windows.
