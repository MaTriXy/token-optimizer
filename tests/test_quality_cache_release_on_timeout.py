"""``quality_cache`` releases its lease lock even when the wall-clock
deadline fires mid-computation.

``_HookTimeout`` inherits from ``BaseException`` so inner ``except Exception``
blocks cannot swallow it. Before the fix, ``_release_quality_lock`` was called
only at explicit returns, NOT in a ``finally``; a ``_HookTimeout`` raised
between acquire and release skipped release entirely, leaking the per-nonce
candidate hard link too. The fix wraps the locked region in ``try/finally`` so
``_release_quality_lock`` (idempotent + guarded) runs on every exit, including
the ``BaseException`` path.

This test injects ``_HookTimeout`` at ``compute_quality_score`` (mid-compute,
after acquire, before any inline release) and asserts the candidate is unlinked
in the finally.
