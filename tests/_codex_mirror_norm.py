"""Shared helper: normalize the Codex marketplace mirror's runtime version-resolver
back to the root's simple launcher guard.

The sync script (sync-codex-marketplace-plugin.sh) applies three intentional
transforms to the Codex mirror's hooks.json: async-strip, SessionEnd-timeout
clamp, and — for launcher commands — a rewrite of the fail-open guard into a
runtime version-resolver (Codex pins ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} to the session's
plugin version, so scanning for the newest dir heals a mid-session refresh).

Tests that assert "the mirror equals the root except for the sanctioned
transforms" use `guard_from_resolver` to undo the resolver rewrite before
comparing, so they still catch any *other* drift.

Keep _RESOLVER / _GUARD byte-identical to the sync script.
