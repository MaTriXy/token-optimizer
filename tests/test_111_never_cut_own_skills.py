"""Issue #111: Token Optimizer must NEVER recommend cutting its own skills.

The first thing the tool did for a user was suggest trimming the token-optimizer
bundle (token-coach, fleet-auditor) to "save ~200 tokens" — self-cannibalizing.
The unused-skill / archive recommender now excludes our own measurement skills
regardless of invocation history.
