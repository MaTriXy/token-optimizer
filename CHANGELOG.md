## [Unreleased]

- Fix: the token-saving hooks now reach every supported harness. Codex, Cowork, and manual installs get the same savings as Claude Code -- startup diagnostics stay out of the model's context, and the command-failure and long-output nudges reach the model through each host's supported channel.
- Fix: SessionStart no longer adds anything to the model's context. Startup diagnostics (health checks, dashboard setup, daemon status) now write to a local log file instead of stdout/stderr, both of which the host captures into the session context. Sessions begin at their true baseline, so the token savings start on the first turn.
- Add: burn nudge. When the same command fails 3 times in a row with different output, a nudge suggests changing approach instead of re-running. Catches the edit-compile-fail cycle that the existing identical-output streak guard cannot see. Tunable with `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_FAIL_STREAK_THRESHOLD` (default `3`).
- Add: inline-script repeat nudge. When a command with a heredoc body >= 300 chars has been run 8 times in a session, a nudge suggests saving the script to a file and running that instead, so the body is not re-sent as input tokens every turn. Tunable with `TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_INLINE_SCRIPT_THRESHOLD` (default `8`).
