"""session-end-flush must defer by DEFAULT.

A legacy bare `measure.py session-end-flush` hook (pre-5.11.77 script installs,
no --defer flag) fossilizes in ~/.claude/settings.json, and no self-heal path
rewrites it. Before this fix the dispatch deferred only when `--defer` was in
argv, so the fossil ran the heavy flush synchronously inline on updated 5.11.81
scripts and wedged Windows stop-hooks at 3/4.

The fix inverts the gate: defer unless `--no-defer` is passed. These tests pin
that decision at `_dispatch_session_end_flush` without spawning any worker.
