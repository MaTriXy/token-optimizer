"""Single-import SessionStart dispatcher.

Replaces the FIVE separate ``SessionStart`` hook commands in hooks.json that
each spawned ``python-launcher.sh -> run.py -> module_runner.py ->
runpy(measure.py)`` and repeated the interpreter and module startup work:

  1. ``measure.py ensure-health --once-mark``                       (timeout 15, async)
  2. ``measure.py quality-cache --force --quiet --once-mark``       (timeout 20)
  3. ``measure.py compact-restore --compact``       [matcher compact] (timeout 20)
  4. ``read_cache.py --clear-compacted --quiet``    [matcher compact] (timeout 10)
  5. ``measure.py compact-restore --new-session-only --once-mark``  (timeout 20)

This runner is invoked ONCE per session start, imports ``measure.py`` ONCE, and
runs all five subcommands in-process under ONE shared deadline. That removes
repeated startup work while keeping the host-specific timeout as a backstop.

This is the same consolidation the ``UserPromptSubmit`` group received in
``hooks/userpromptsubmit_runner.py``; SessionStart never got it. The
structure here deliberately mirrors that file.

Key properties:
  - ONE shared ``HookDeadline`` (18s, 2s margin under the hooks.json timeout of
    20, and 7s under Codex's hard 25s SessionStart ceiling) replaces the five
    independent per-entry timeouts. Remaining time is budgeted fairly across the
    subcommands still pending (``_runner_budget``); the shared deadline's
    ``os._exit(0)`` is the ONLY kill switch in the process, so an early
    subcommand hang can never preemptively kill later ones.
  - ``--once-mark`` latching semantics are preserved EXACTLY: subcommands 1, 2
    and 5 call ``measure._mark_ran_this_session`` (WRITE, never check), so the
    SessionStart work always runs -- including on the second SessionStart of a
    session (resume / post-compaction keep the same session_id) --
    while the ``--once-per-session`` UserPromptSubmit copies stay latched out.
    No unlink-on-failure here: the ``--once-mark`` semantics differ from the
    retryable ``--once-per-session`` flow and must remain distinct.
  - The ``matcher: "compact"`` gate on subcommands 3 and 4 is replicated
    in-process by ``_is_compact_start`` (the SessionStart ``source`` field the
    host matches on), so a non-compact start skips them exactly as the matcher
    did.
  - The consent gate that run.py used to apply per-entry is applied per
    subcommand HERE: ensure-health was consent-EXEMPT (it bootstraps the consent
    flags), the other four were consent-gated. run.py exempts this runner path
    wholesale, same as the UserPromptSubmit runner.
  - stdout from the two compact-restore subcommands is captured and emitted in
    dispatch order at the end of ``main()`` as ONE host-valid JSON envelope
    (raw text, systemMessage JSON, additionalContext JSON). ensure-health and
    quality-cache stdout is diagnostic and routed to a log file, never to the
    envelope. All subcommand stderr is also routed to the log file -- the host
    captures both stdout and stderr into the model's session context, so
    diagnostics must reach neither stream.
  - One subcommand throwing/aborting never aborts the others (each is wrapped in
    ``_run_safely``); the hook always exits 0. Failure notices and tracebacks
    go to the diagnostics log file, not stderr.
  - ``run._check_consent`` is imported by explicit path so a future
    ``skills/.../run.py`` on ``sys.path`` cannot shadow the real gate.

The runner calls the same module-level entrypoints used by the ``__main__``
dispatch, preserving their arguments and behavior while only changing how
they are scheduled.

Run: ``hooks/sessionstart_runner.py`` (via run.py -> module_runner.py).

# (`detect_runtime() == "codex" or is_cowork()`) was dead code on Codex: Codex
# sets neither CODEX_HOME nor TOKEN_OPTIMIZER_RUNTIME in a hook subprocess (only
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT / CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA), so detect_runtime() returns "claude"
# inside a Codex plugin hook and the raw "[Token Optimizer] ..." text went out
# unwrapped -- "hook returned invalid session start JSON output". The envelope is
# valid on BOTH hosts, so there is nothing to detect.
#
# It also has to be ONE object, not one per subcommand: pre-consolidation each
# subcommand owned its own stdout stream; now they share one, and two JSON
# documents on a single stream is exactly what Codex refuses to parse. See
# tests/test_codex_sessionstart_json_contract.py for the verified contract.
