"""Regression test: CLAUDE.md findings must report per-file, not blended.

Reimplements the direction of external PR #100 by danikdanik
(https://github.com/alexgreensh/token-optimizer/pull/100), reconciled onto the
current tree (our savings math moved from the ~4,500-token internal heuristic
to Anthropic's documented 200-line guidance, so the assertions here check the
per-file BEHAVIOR rather than the PR's original wording).

measure_components() keys each ancestor CLAUDE.md as its own component
(claude_md_global, claude_md_home, claude_md_project_<dir>), mirroring how
Claude Code loads CLAUDE.md files up the directory tree. quick_scan's offender
list, its quick_win, and generate_auto_recommendations' Rule 2 all used to sum
every claude_md*-prefixed key into one blended number and report it as if it
were a single file. On a layout with 2-3 CLAUDE.md files that produced a
token/line count matching no real file, plus a "slim to N lines" action that
was not actionable on any one of them -- and it could fire on a combined total
when no individual file was over threshold.
