"""A missed SessionStart must not blank ContextQ for the rest of the session.

The quality cache is created by SessionStart (`quality-cache --force --quiet
--once-mark`, timeout 20s). If that hook times out -- a busy machine, a boot
storm, a heavy benchmark, i.e. exactly when someone looks at the statusline --
nothing else created it, and the statusline showed `ContextQ:--` for the whole
session with no way back.

The recovery already existed in `userpromptsubmit_runner.py`, but it sat behind
`_harness_only_context()`, which is true only for containers, remote, or a
CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT containing "harness"/"/plugins/synced/". A normal local user
never reached it. So the in-code claim that "UserPromptSubmit owns the initial
computation" was true only in harness contexts, and false for everyone else.

The fix runs that ONE recovery outside the harness gate, and only when the cache
file is genuinely absent.

What must NOT change: PostToolUse still refuses to bootstrap. It fires on every
tool call, and a transcript parse there is a latency regression. That invariant
is owned by
tests/test_hook_runtime_parity.py::test_throttle_only_cache_miss_never_parses_transcript;
these tests exist to make sure the ContextQ fix never buys itself by breaking it.
